    The three-dimensional velocities of stars can reveal their orbital
    properties and their kinematic ages.
Precise Gaia measurements of positions, parallaxes and proper motions provide
    an opportunity to measure the two-dimensional velocities of billions of
    Galactic stars and, for many, radial velocity (RV) measurements, available
    from spectroscopic surveys provide an opportunity to
    calculate three-dimensional velocities.
Although Gaia will provide RVs for stars as faint as 15th magnitude in its
    third data release, there are now and will remain many stars without
    RV measurements.
In many cases however, it is still possible to infer full three-dimensional
    velocities by marginalizing over missing RV measurements.
In this paper, we infer the three-dimensional Galactocentric velocities of
    stars in the Kepler field (\vx, \vy, \vz).
At a low galactic latitude, the Kepler field is oriented close to the y-axis
    of the Galactocentric coordinate system.
This means that, without RVs, \vy\ is poorly constrained, but \vx\ and \vy\
    can be precisely inferred.
For many applications (including kinematic age-dating), having precise
    velocities in the \vz\ and \vx\ directions are sufficient.
Although our methodology is broadly applicable to targets across the sky, our
prior is specifically constructed for the Kepler field.
Care should be taken, when applying this method to other parts of the Galaxy,
that a suitable prior is used.
