\subsection{Inferred velocities}

In this section we assess the quality of the 3D stellar velocities we infer.
Figure \ref{fig:results} shows the distribution of stellar velocities inferred
for 5000 randomly selected Kepler stars.
The 2D distributions of inferred stellar velocities are plotted in the
lower-left panels, with black contours indicating the stellar number density.
The red contours in these panels show the marginal projections of the
Gaussian prior in 2D.
The diagonal panels show the 1D distributions (histograms) of stellar
velocities.
The black histogram shows the distribution of inferred velocities, the cyan
histogram shows the distribution of velocities calculated for stars with RVs
(on which the prior was based), and the red lines show the 1D prior
distributions.
The prior distribution was calculated using the velocities of stars with RVs.
If the velocity distributions of stars were Gaussian, the 1D red Gaussians
would look like the cyan histograms.
In other words, the differences between the red lines and cyan histograms
is caused by the non-Gaussianity of the velocity distributions.
{\bf This figure is intended to highlight the differences and similarities
between the inferred stellar velocities and the prior distributions}.
In each panel, the distribution of inferred velocities is fairly similar to
the distribution of directly-measured velocities; the velocities of stars
calculated with and without RVs are broadly similar.
{\bf The inferred \vx\ and \vz\ velocities, and distances are relatively
precise, with median uncertainties of \vxprecision \kms, \vzprecision\ \kms,
and \dprecision\ kpc, respectively.
The inferred \vy\ velocities have a median uncertainty of \vyprecision\ \kms}.

% Among stars with measured RVs, \vy\ and \vz\ are slightly positively
% correlated, \ie\ stars with larger \vy\ tend to have larger \vz.
There is a slight negative correlation between inferred \vy\ and \vz\
velocities, which is visible in the central panel of figure \ref{fig:results}.
This negative correlation is not seen in the prior, nor is it apparent in the
posteriors of individual stars: figure \ref{fig:posterior} shows that the \vy\
and \vz\ parameters are {\it positively} correlated for KIC \kicstar.
The negative correlation seen in the population of inferred velocities is
caused by the specific orientation of the Kepler field which creates a slight
degeneracy between \vy\ and \vz.
This orientation creates a negative correlation in the population of stars,
that is not apparent in the posteriors of individual stars.
To an observer looking at Kepler field, a star with either a positive \vz\ or
a {\it negative} \vy\ would appear to move in the direction of positive \vz,
when projected onto the sky.
In this sense, \vy\ and \vz\ are negatively correlated.
However, the observed proper motions of a star without a measured RV could be
equally well described by either increasing both \vy\ and \vz, or decreasing
both \vy\ and \vz.
For this reason, the star's posterior PDF over \vy\ and \vz\ will be
positively correlated.
This results in a paradox that is similar to Simpson's paradox: the posteriors
over vy and vz are positively correlated for individual stars, however the vy
and vz velocities of the population are negatively correlated.

% could have {\it
% either} a positive \vz, or a postitive \vy. with a positive
% \vz\
% This difference is caused by the way the inaccuracies in inferred \vy\
% velocities manifest in the \vz\ velocity distribution.
% Although correlation patterns appear between the inferred velocities as a
% result of marginalizing over RV, the inferred velocities are still consistent
% with their `true' velocities.
% The proper motions of stars with a given \vy\ and \vz\ could be equally
% well-described with a slightly larger \vy\ and a smaller \vz\ or vice versa.

The distribution of inferred stellar velocities and distances.
    Figure \ref{fig:results} shows the inferred velocities of 5000 randomly
selected Kepler stars.
The 2D distributions of inferred stellar velocities are plotted in the
lower-left panels, with black contours indicating the stellar number density.
The red contours in the lower-left panels show the marginal projections of
    the Gaussian prior distribution in 2D.
The upper-right panels in the figure, lying on the plot's diagonal, show the
    1D distributions (histograms) of stellar velocities.
The black histogram shows the distribution of inferred velocities, the blue
histogram shows the distribution of velocities for stars with RVs,
and the red lines show the 1D marginal Gaussian prior distributions.
{\bf This figure shows that the distributions of inferred velocities are
    broadly similar to the distributions of velocities directly calculated
    using RVs, and the prior constructed from them.}

To further validate our method, we compare inferred velocities with
directly-calculated velocities for stars in our sample with measured RVs.
Figure \ref{fig:residuals} shows the \vx, \vy\ and \vz\ velocities, and
distances we inferred, compared with those calculated from measured RVs, for
5000 Kepler stars chosen at random.

The three velocity components, \vx, \vy\ and \vz\ were recovered with
differing levels of precision: \vx\ and \vz\ are inferred more precisely than
\vy.
This is because of the position of the \kepler\ field, shown in figure
\ref{fig:kepler_field}.
The velocities of low-\vy\ stars are overestimated and the velocities of
high-\vy\ stars are underestimated.
This is because there is little information to constrain the \vy\ velocities
and the prior pulls the \vy\ velocities toward the center of the distribution.
The \vx, \vy\ and \vz\ velocities of stars are correlated, which means that
stars with an inaccurate \vy\ also have slightly accurate \vz\ and \vx.
Despite slight systematic inaccuracies {\bf visible in the residual (bottom)
panels of figure \ref{fig:residuals}}, around 68\% of the inferred velocities
are within 1$\sigma$ of their true velocities; the inferred velocities are
consistent with the true velocities.

We provide a table of the directly-calculated, and indirectly-inferred 3D
velocities of stars observed by Kepler, in addition to their positional and
velocity information from Gaia EDR3, LAMOST DR5 and APOGEE DR16.
A description of each column included in that table is provided in table
\ref{tab:columns}.
