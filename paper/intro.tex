\section{Introduction}

% Motivation
Main-sequence dwarfs are the most common stars in the Milky Way, and their
ages could reveal the evolution of Galactic stellar populations and planetary
systems.
However, the ages of low-mass stars, particularly K and M dwarfs are difficult
to measure because their luminosities and temperatures evolve slowly on the
main sequence \citep[see][for a review of stellar ages]{soderblom2010}.
Empirical models that relate the magnetic activity or rotation periods of
stars to their age can be used to infer the ages of some low-mass dwarfs
\citep{citations}.
However, these empirical relations are often poorly calibrated for K and M
dwarfs and old stars \citep{citations}.
Galactic kinematics provide an alternative dating method.

The star forming molecular gas clouds observed in the Milky Way have a low
out-of-plane, or vertical, velocity \citep[\eg][]{stark1989, stark2005,
aumer2009, martig2014, aumer2016}.
In contrast, the vertical velocities of older stars are observed to be larger
in magnitude on average \citep{stromberg1946, wielen1977, nordstrom2004,
holmberg2007, holmberg2009, aumer2009, casagrande2011, ting2019, yu2018}.
There are two possible explanations for this observed increase in velocity
dispersion with age: either stars are born kinematically `cool' and their
orbits are heated over time via interactions with giant molecular clouds
\citep[see][for a review of secular evolution in the MW]{sellwood2014}, or
stars formed kinematically `hotter' in the past \citep[\eg][]{bird2013}.
Either way, the vertical velocity dispersions of thin disk stars are observed
to increase with stellar age.
This behavior is codified by Age-Velocity dispersion Relations (AVRs), which
typically express the relationship between age and velocity dispersion as a
power law: $\sigma_v \propto t^\beta$, with free parameter, $\beta$
\citep[\eg][]{holmberg2009, yu2018}.
These expressions can be used to infer the ages of groups of stars from their
velocity dispersions.

Kinematic ages have been used to explore the evolution of cool dwarfs for over
a decade.
For example, \citet{west2004, west2006} found that the fraction of
magnetically active M dwarfs decreases over time, by using the vertical
distances of stars from the Galactic mid-plane as an age proxy, and
\citet{west2008} used kinematic ages to calculate the expected activity
lifetime for M dwarfs of different spectral types.
\citet{faherty2009} used tangential velocities to infer the ages of M, L and T
dwarfs, and showed that dwarfs with lower surface gravities tended to be
kinematically younger, and \citet{kiman2019} used velocity dispersion as an
age proxy to explore the evolution of H$\alpha$ equivalent width (a magnetic
activity indicator), in M dwarfs.
In \citet{angus2020} we explored the kinematic properties of Kepler field
stars and found that the velocity dispersion of stars increase with stellar
rotation period, as expected (because both quantities increase with age).
In \citet{lu2021} we used the velocity dispersions of Kepler field stars to
estimate their ages using an Age-Velocity dispersion Relation (AVR).

AVRs are usually calibrated in Galactocentric velocity coordinates (\vx, \vy,
\vz\ or $UVW$), and these velocities can only be calculated with full 6D
positional and velocity information, however most \kepler\ rotators do not
have RV measurements\footnote{Although RVs for most will be released in \gaia\
DR3}.
In \citep{angus2020} we used velocity in the direction of Galactic latitude
(\vb) as a stand-in for \vz\ because, in the {\it Galactic} coordinate system,
velocities can be calculated from 3D positions and {\it 2D} proper motions.
The \kepler\ field lies at low Galactic latitude, so \vb\ is a close
approximation to \vz\ for Kepler stars.
Although \vb\ velocity dispersion does not equal \vz\ velocity dispersion, it
still increases monotonically over time and provides accurate age rankings for
\kepler\ stars.
In this paper however, we calculate or infer \vz\ for each Kepler star in our
sample.
For stars without RV measurements we infer {\it vertical} velocity, \vz, by
marginalizing over missing RVs using a hierarchical Bayesian model.
The vertical velocities presented in this paper were used by \citet{lu2021} to
calculate the velocity dispersions of groups of stars with similar properties,
which they then converted into ages using an AVR \citep{yu2018}.
In this work, we extend the work of \citet{lu2021} by applying their kinematic
dating method to stars with marginal rotation period detections in the Kepler
field \citep{mcquillan2014}.
We compare the kinematic ages of stars with and without rotation period
detections, and those with marginal detections.

This paper is laid out as follows.
In section \ref{sec:method} we describe how we calculate the kinematic ages of
Kepler stars from their positions, proper motions and parallaxes (and RVs
where available).
We also justify the choice of prior probability density function (PDF).
In section \ref{sec:results} we use the 3D velocities of Kepler stars to
calculate the kinematic ages of stars with marginal rotation period
detections using the method of \citet{lu2021}.
In section \ref{sec:discussion} we discuss the implications of our results and
the applications and caveats of our velocities and velocity-inference code.
